# Visualization

## Description
Please find within this directory all the files necessary to run the current iteration of this project's visualization.
The code is intended to be run from within a Jupyter-style notebook environment. Within such an environment, it will
automatically install all additional required dependencies via `pip` and `apt`.

We have also included the python script conversion of this notebook, although that will likely not run without a minor
degree of massaging.

## Contents
 - VisualizationSnapshotMarch26th.ipynb
   - The Jupyter notebook that runs this tool as-intended.
 - VisualizationSnapshotMarch26th.py
   - An untested python script conversion of the above Jupyter notebook.
